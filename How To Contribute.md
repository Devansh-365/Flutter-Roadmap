# How to contribute

We are very pleased that you have decided to help with this project.

If you want to contribute, the first thing you should do is think of a topic or edit an existing one.

### Create a new topic

When you create a new topic, please create a new markdown file in the directory "Drafts" and name the file after the topic. As you write, keep the following criteria in mind:

- When you link sources, i.e. YouTube videos, articles, websites or other, you go by the following scheme
    - [{Author} - {Title} :] {Source}
        - Everything in [] will be written bold.
- Follow the writing style used in the other topics so that the whole repository looks consistent.
- Research your topic well and make sure you haven't forgotten anything.
- When you quote something, always cite the source. A citation should look like this:
    - "{Citation}" ({Source}) - {Optional Author}

### Edit an existing topic

When editing an existing topic, you should follow the same formatting as when creating a new topic:

- When you link sources, i.e. YouTube videos, articles, websites or other, you go by the following scheme
    - [{Author} - {Title} :] {Source}
        - Everything in [] will be written bold.
- Follow the writing style used in the other topics so that the whole repository looks consistent.
- Research your topic well and make sure you haven't forgotten anything.
- When you quote something, always cite the source. A citation should look like this:
    - "{Citation}" ({Source}) - {Optional Author}

Also, do not remove sources that are still current and pertinent to the topic. If you are editing the topic because a source is no longer current, you can remove it, but it would be good to include a new source for the current "version".

We wish you good luck with contributing!
