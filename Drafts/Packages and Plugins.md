## Packages and Plugins

Packages and plugins can save you many hours of time. If you need a special widget, animation or backend manager, maybe someone has already developed something for it. 
And the probability is very high for that, because thousands of people publish packages on pub.dev. 
So in short, it's one of the most important things in Flutter & Dart. 
Now what exactly packages are and how you can add them is explained to you, as always, by Flutter.

But, We are writing about packages **AND** plugins all the time. 
This doc only very briefly explained what the difference is, so now let's take a look at a video from Flutter about it:

Respect! You have already reached the next level to become a Flutter developer!
