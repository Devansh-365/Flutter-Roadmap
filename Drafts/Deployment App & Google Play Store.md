## Deploying your app to the App Store & Google Play Store
Wow, you're almost at the end of the course now. Of course, now you want to publish your app to the App Store and Google Play Store. There is a detailed explanation for each platform in the Flutter Docs, so let's start with Android now.

I also found a video from Johannes Milke about this, which explains this process in great detail:

**Johannes Milke - Flutter Tutorial - How To Publish Flutter App On Play Store [2021] Build, Release & Deploy App:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0GNuoCOtaQ

Now let's take a look at how we make our app available to iOS users.

If you want to watch a video on this, I found one from MSJD Coding:

Very nice. Next, let's look at how to deploy our Flutter app to Windows, macOS and Linux.
