## Working with user inputs and forms
User inputs are needed in almost every app. Be it for the login, the searchbar or other things. And you've already worked with this a lot, but let's take another look at what's behind it, as this is a very important topic in Flutter.

And this time, we're not going to draw on the Flutter documentation. We will look at a YouTube channel called "Johannes Milke" as our main source this time. He has made two very good videos on TextFields and Form & TextFormFields. 

What is the difference between TextField and TextFormField is what we will look at first.
Flutter Agency has written a very good article on this:

Okay, now that we have that cleared up, we can move on to the first widget, the TextField.
A full DeepDive on this widget was done by Johannes Milke on his YouTube channel:
**Johannes Milke - Flutter Tutorial - TextField - Deep Dive:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5hJIKCTrvk

Great, so now we know how the TextField widget works.
Now let's take a look at how the TextFormField widget works with the Form widget.
Again, Johannes Milke has created a very good video which we will now look at:
**Johannes Milke - Flutter Tutorial - How To Use Form and TextFormField [2021 UPDATE]:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rn3XbBijy4

Great, then we have taken another big step and now we are slowly getting into the more challenging area.
