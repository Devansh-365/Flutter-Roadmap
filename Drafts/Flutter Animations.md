# Flutter Animations
We have come to the most fun and my favorite part **Animations**. Animations makes your ui look alive and provides a great ux. Now this is a topic most people get scared of but fear not animations in Flutter are the most easiest with a few lines of code you can create so beautiful animations. 

[This article](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/animations) from [Flutter's official docs](https://flutter.dev) will help you get started. And if you need animations which occurs one after another in other words staggered animations here is another article about it https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/animations/staggered-animations. Thats it for resources from the official docs.

This is a bit old but this playlist is from the official flutter youtube channel and its one of the best out there:

**Flutter - Making Animations in Flutter:** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU2v6UqYlt_KPaXlnjbYySua

This is a big one but its worth looking at:

**Flutter - Flutter Europe: Animations in Flutter done right:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnARLByOtKA&t=1480s


If you need the animations showed here https://material.io/design/motion/understanding-motion.html#principles the material.io team made an excelent package for just that https://pub.dev/packages/animations. (One tip if you need some resources about UI and UX always look at [Material Design docs](https://material.io)).

Here is another great video about Staggered Animations from Reso Coder:

**Reso Coder - Staggered Animations Made Simple – Flutter Simple Animations Tutorial:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB3f6gjbX1g&t=102s

And some other great videos from the same author:

**Reso Coder - Flutter Animation Tutorial – Refactoring with AnimatedWidget & AnimatedBuilder:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-h_e4b71o8<br />
**Reso Coder - Flutter Animation Tutorial - Understand the Basics & Animate with Ease:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txLvvlooT20

All the resources I mentioned are animations done using code but if you need 3d animations that you can draw look at [Rive](http://rive.app/)

Now all the resources I mentioned some are old but they are great ones and can be easily used with a bit of modication to the code
