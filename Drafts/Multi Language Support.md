## Multi Language Support
An app that is offered in multiple languages and is understandable for the whole world is what every app developer wants. Of course, we don't teach you how to learn different languages, but rather how to get the different languages into your app. For this we use INTL & ARB files, as this is one of the most used systems. A very good tutorial about this has been made by Johannes Milke, which explains everything very detailed:
