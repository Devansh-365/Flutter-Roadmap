## Theming
You've already learned a lot about theming in the last tutorials, maybe you knew, maybe you didn't. 
Now, let's take another look at how it works and what it does exactly, so let's get right into it.

Again, theming is explained to us very well by the Flutter Docs, so, as always, let's take a look there ;)

Great, now we have also learned how to use themes, but in Flutter we can also do so much more. 
For example, we can use downloaded fonts that are not already implemented in Flutter. Therefore, let's take a look at that as well.
https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/fonts

There is also the possibility to import fonts from a package (the one we looked at before). We will read how to do that and then we are almost done with the theming.

We can import files like videos, images etc. from the assets in a similar way as with fonts. For this we do something similar to importing like fonts:

Great, now we are done with theming, letâ€™s continue!

Oh, and a little tip on the side: There is a very popular package called google_fonts. You can use 977 fonts from fonts.google.com directly.
