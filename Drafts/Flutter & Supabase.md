## Flutter & Supabase

Supabase calls itself an alternative to Firebase. And in my opinion it is. A huge advantage is that you can host it on your own server, but also that Supabase is open source. Also, this company is currently growing very fast, so it's a huge advantage if you start learning it now, so you'll have an advantage over newcomers later when Supabase is very big.

Okay, now enough of the long introduction, let's get started:

The first thing we need to do is understand Supabase and how to use each of its features. For this, Traversy Media has made a **great** tutorial, which you should definitely check out:

Okay, we now know how Supabase works, but we haven't written a single line of code in Dart yet. Since Supabase is very small, unlike Firebase, as I said before, there are very few tutorials about it. So now we have to refer to the documentation:

I highly recommend doing the bonus part!

Supa, now we have also learned the next technology in combination with Flutter!

You are making very good progress!
