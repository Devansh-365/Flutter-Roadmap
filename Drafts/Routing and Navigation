## Routing and Navigation
Routing is one of the most important things you need as a Flutter developer, because you will very rarely create an app that has a single screen. And also this has been shown to you in other videos, but we really want to understand what it all means and how it works.

One of the best YouTube channels for Flutter, Reso Coder, did a great tutorial on routing. Let's take a look at this one now.

If you want, you can also read through the Navigator class in the docs again:

Great, now we already know the basics. But there is now a Navigator 2.0, which is more or less liked by the Flutter community. Nevertheless, it is important to know how it works. That's why we're going to look at an article on Medium that explains how we can use Navigator 2.0:

And again, we have completed a very important topic. You will soon be a Flutter Pro!
