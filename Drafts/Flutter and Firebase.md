## Flutter & Firebase
Firebase is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) product developed by Google to make app development a lot easier. It offers tons of features, such as Authentication, WebHosting, Database Storage, Analytics (connected with Google Analytics), Engage (Predictions, A/B Testing...) and Relase & Monitor (Crashlytics, Performance...).
As you can see, Firebase offers a lot of functionalities and therefore it is very important to know it well.

Since there are so many functionalities, we will really only cover the basics now, but you can implement just about any functionality of Firebase into your app using the [FlutterFire Docs](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/analytics/overview).

We're going to take a look at how you can authenticate a user and store data in Firebase using a codelab from Firebase:

You can also find many great articles on this page from Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/firebase

Great, we now know how to manage users, store data in Firebase and we also know where to find help if we don't know how to implement something in our app.
