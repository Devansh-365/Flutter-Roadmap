## Using native device functionalities
Native device functionalities are things like microphone usage, camera, picture gallery and GPS. You can also use such things in Flutter and we will now look at how to do this.

As you should have noticed during the course, Johannes Milke always creates very good tutorials on certain topics. And he has created great tutorials on this topic as well:

### Location

Unfortunately I didn't find a tutorial from Johannes Milke about Location of the user, however Flutter made a great tutorial about the package location:
