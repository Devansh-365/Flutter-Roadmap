## Flutter Widgets
Now we finally start working with Flutter. 
Flutter is based on widgets, as you should have learned by now.
So now let's take a look at what Flutter widgets and also look at the most important of them. 
As always, the documentation can answer that for us (don't worry, we'll be using other sources soon).
So, let's read through the Introduction to Widgets:

**Introduction to widgets:** https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro

Whooow, a lot was explained there.
Of course, not every widget was explained. 
There are hundreds, if not thousands of widgets in Flutter, but it is not necessary to know them all. 
As time goes by, you will learn more and more widgets, either through tutorials or just research on the internet. 
In this course you will also get to know a lot more widgets.
