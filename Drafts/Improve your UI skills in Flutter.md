## Improve your UI skills in Flutter

Now that we've looked at how to create your first Flutter apps, let's take a look at how to create a beautiful UI in Flutter. 
There's a great YouTube channel called The Flutter Way that creates the best UIs in Flutter you've ever seen. 
So here you will get a list of UI Speed Codes where you will learn many things like Animations, Dark & Light Theme and Responsive Design. 
You can, if you want, just watch them, since there is no talking there unfortunately, or you can code along yourself, which we recommend, since you will learn much better that way. 
You will be able to see for yourself what will change after a hot reload and you can learn a lot from that as well. 

So here is your list:

**The Flutter Way - Flutter Custom Animation - Grocery App - Speed Code:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCQQJ42zC58&t=49s

**The Flutter Way - Analog Clock Light & Dark Theme - Flutter UI - Speed Code:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6Cfzng3Gek

**The Flutter Way - Flutter Fully Responsive Design for Web, Tab and Mobile:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mp-Ok00WZE

Wow, you have now learned how to use Text, RichText, Containers, Shadow and much more. 
On top of that, you've learned how to create custom animations, bring Dark & Light Theme into your app and even create Responsive designs. 
That was a lot and you just took a huge step. We'll take a closer look at Animations, Dark & Light Theme and Responsive Design later, as there are several solutions there and some tutorials from The Flutter Way already have newer solutions for them.
The main purpose of this section was simply to teach you UI design in Flutter.

By now you have learned how to add packages to the pubspec.yaml file, but what are packages and what is the difference between a package and a plugin? That's what we're going to look at now.
