## Error Handling
It can happen very often that an error happens in your app for which you can't be held responsible. Maybe the API is not working properly (we have already learned how to work with APIs and Rest APIs), the user is not connected to the Internet and much more. This is annoying, of course, but this is exactly the kind of situation you need error handling for. You check, so to speak, if an error occurs, whereupon you then execute a certain action. If there is no error, then you can just continue and if there is, then you might show the user that something went wrong. Now let's look at how we implement this.

When Reso Coder makes a video about a topic, it is very well done. So now let's take a look at ResoCoder's two videos on Error Handling:
