# Flutter-Roadmap
In this repository you will learn Flutter from scratch, so that after that you are almost a Flutter pro and the whole thing is completely free.

## What is Flutter?

In the beginning, of course, you need to know what Flutter is. There are many short but very good videos on Youtube.

Here are the best I could find:

**London App Brewery - What is Flutter?:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9ceqw5Ny-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9ceqw5Ny-4)

**Google Developers - Introducing Flutter:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4N0hgOWzU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4N0hgOWzU)

**Fireship - Flutter in 100 seconds (my favorite for short explanations):** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHhRhPV--G0&t=32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHhRhPV--G0&t=32s)

In a nutshell, Flutter is this:

Flutter is Google's portable UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source. Flutter primarily uses Dart (a language also developed by Google).

## What is Dart?

Okay, now we have clarified what Flutter is. Next, we'll take a look at what Dart actually is, because this is the programming language you'll be programming in.

Again, there is a video on YouTube, which will help you there:

**Google Developers - Introducing Dart:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KlnlCq2M5Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KlnlCq2M5Q)

Maybe this explanation is not enough for you and you want to understand a bit deeper what Dart is. You need to know that Dart and Flutter have great docs and you could theoretically learn everything from them. That's why I found an overview about Dart here:

[https://dart.dev/overview](https://dart.dev/overview)

Okay, now that we have learned what Flutter & Dart are, let's start installing Flutter & Dart.

## Installing Flutter & Dart

Installing Flutter & Dart is relatively easy once you understand how to do it.

Since Flutter's documentation is so great, I'm linking all the articles you need here so you have a complete Flutter setup.

**Windows Install:** [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows)

**Macos Install:** [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos)

**Linux Install:** [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux)

**Chrome OS Install:** [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/chromeos](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/chromeos)

For all links you should go at least from step 1-3. After that you will have Flutter completely set up. I highly recommend using VSCode, as all the extensions I mention in the rest of this repository are for VSCode.

## The Ultimate Flutter Setup

Wait a minute... we're not done installing Flutter yet?

Yes, basically we are. You could create your first apps right now. But, there are so many more things that will make you a real productivity beast in Flutter.

Robert Brunhage once made a video called "The Ultimate Flutter Setup 2021".

It's best to start with this video:

**Robert Brunhage - The Ultimate Flutter Setup:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhumfOSYFNc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhumfOSYFNc)

Since not everything is really direct for Flutter, here are all the timestamps you should definitely check out:

**Extensions:** 0:26-3:41

2:26 Pubspec Assist - Since version Flutter 2.5, the standard Flutter extension has exactly the same features built in as Pubspec Assist, so you don't need to install that package anymore.

**Snippets:** 3:41-4:40

**CI/CD:** 8:37-9:59

**FVM:** 9:59-10:53

In this video is not properly explained how to set up FVM, that's why he made a seperate video about FVM, where he explains what FVM is, how to set it up and use it in his projects. 
**Robert Brunhage - Flutter Productivity Beast - FVM:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5HsXg5KlYE

**Linting:** 10:53-12:42 (end)

The video was made before Flutter 2.5. Since Flutter 2.5 exists, linting is included by default in every project, which means you don't need to use an extra package for it, in my opinion.

Okay, now we already have the first killer things set up that clearly make us more productive, but a few things are still coming from my side that you should add.

Let's start with the extensions:

I downloaded a few more extensions than Robert Brunhage has, which I will introduce here:
**Flutter Color:** Flutter Color is one of the best flutter extensions available. It automatically detects if you have entered a color somewhere. Then. it shows you a little box to the left of it with the color you wrote in the code. If you click on this box, you get a color picker, with which you can select a color, which is then automatically written into the code.

**Awesome Flutter Snippets:** Flutter snippets are very helpful, but configuring them all yourself can be a pain. That's why this extension offers many more snippets that will make your work much more productive.

I will add more extensions as soon as I find new ones.

## Dart Syntax & Basics

Before we really get started, we need to understand the programming language we are programming in. That's why we're going to take a look at the syntax of Dart.

As already mentioned 2x, Dart has a great documentation, so there is a Language Tour in the Docs. This is very long, I know that, but if you have read and understood this article, then you can definitely say that you understand the Dart syntax and can already code in Dart.

**Dart - Dart Language Tour:** [https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)

We know it sounds like a boring task to you, but without taking away your motivation: If you want to master Flutter & Dart properly, then you need to read through this article and many more. So, consider this the first step to great success!

## Effective Dart

Okay, now it's going to get really hard, but we promise you, once you get through this step, there's a little bit easier stuff to come.

We want to understand darts really well, because after this course you should really be able to create your dream apps. That's why I have to torture you with 4 more articles now, unfortunately. 

To read the 4 more articles properly, here's how you should read these 4 guides (a very short article:

**Effective Dart -** [https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)

Now we come to the 4 important articles:

**Effective Dart: Style -** [https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)

**Effective Dart: Documentation -** [https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation)

**Effective Dart: Usage -** [https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/usage](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/usage)

**Effective Dart: Design -** [https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/design](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/design)

## Flutter Widgets
Now we finally start working with Flutter. 
Flutter is based on widgets, as you should have learned by now.
So now let's take a look at what Flutter widgets and also look at the most important of them. 
As always, the documentation can answer that for us (don't worry, we'll be using other sources soon).
So, let's read through the Introduction to Widgets:

**Introduction to widgets:** https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro

Whooow, a lot was explained there.
Of course, not every widget was explained. 
There are hundreds, if not thousands of widgets in Flutter, but it is not necessary to know them all. 
As time goes by, you will learn more and more widgets, either through tutorials or just research on the internet. 
In this course you will also get to know a lot more widgets.

## Create your first Flutter Apps
Yay, it's finally time to start programming! No more tedious theory, let's get on with the practice.

Your first Flutter App will be an infinite list of randomly generated Startup Names. 
This is a project created by a Flutter expert at Google and presented at the Google IO Event 2021. 
In this video everything will be explained to you and you will already get to know the first new widgets.

**Flutter - Building your first Flutter app | Workshop:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6KZ3cTGBWw

Let's go, we have created our first Flutter app, we have to celebrate that ðŸ¥³ !

Now let's have a quick look at a Crash Course by Robert Brunhage, in which he creates a net worth app. 
There was even a contest at the end, which I (Tomic Riedel), the author of this section actually won. 
Even if you can't win anything more, this app is another very good start to get started in Flutter.

**Robert Brunhage - Flutter Crash Course 2021 - Build a Net Worth Application:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktDo9wH4W_4

My respect, you have now already built 2 Flutter apps, you have taken the first important steps to become a pro!

As they say, all good things come in threes, so here comes the third app and the last, for this section. 
Watching this video, you'll probably think to yourself, "I've learned all this already". And yes, that's true. 
In this video we will again briefly summarize everything we have learned so far, but we will learn a few more things there, which are important.
